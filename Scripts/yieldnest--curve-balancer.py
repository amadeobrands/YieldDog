### Update
1. Enhanced the Python code to include features like adding and removing liquidity.
2. Initialized the enhanced AMM Curve model.
3. Performed various operations to demonstrate the enhanced AMM Curve model.
4. Updated the pie chart to display the new distribution of Curve and Balancer LP tokens.

## Updated Steps
1. Study the Curve Finance and Balancer whitepapers to understand the mathematical model behind them.
2. Reviewed uploaded files for any useful code or mathematical equations. Consider reusing or adapting this code.
3. Enhanced and completed the Python code to implement a feature-rich AMM Curve model.
4. Integrated the ability to hold Curve and Balancer LP tokens in the enhanced AMM Curve model.
5. Displayed the updated token distribution in a piechart.
